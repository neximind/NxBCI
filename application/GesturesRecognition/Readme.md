## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before starting:

- ‚úÖ **Python 3.8+** installed
- ‚úÖ **NxBCI EEG/EMG device** ready for use
- ‚úÖ **NVIDIA GPU** (optional, but highly recommended for faster training)
- ‚úÖ Stable wireless network connection

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neximind/NxBCI.git
cd application/GesturesRecognition
```

#### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Create virtual environment
conda create -n Gesture_Recognition python=3.9

# Activate virtual environment
conda activate Gesture_Recognition
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Install PyTorch with GPU Acceleration

For significantly faster model training, install PyTorch with GPU support.

##### Check Your CUDA Version(For Windows/Linux)

First, determine your GPU's maximum supported CUDA version:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

Look for `CUDA Version: X.X` in the top-right corner of the output.

![NVIDIA-SMI Output Example](./images/nvidia-smi.png)

> **üí° Pro Tip:** You can install CUDA for this version or any lower version (e.g., if you see 12.6, you can use 12.1 or 11.8).

##### Install PyTorch

1. Visit the **[PyTorch Official Website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/)**
2. Select your configuration:
   - **OS**: Windows/macOS/Linux
   - **Package Manager**: Conda
   - **Compute Platform**: CUDA version ‚â§ your driver version

**Example installation commands:**

```bash
# For CUDA 12.1
conda install pytorch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia

# For macOS
conda install pytorch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 -c pytorch

# CPU-only (if no GPU available)
conda install pytorch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 cpuonly -c pytorch
```

##### Verify Installation

Test your PyTorch installation:

```python
import torch

device = torch.device("cpu")

if torch.cuda.is_available():
   device = torch.device("cuda")
   print(f"Using CUDA: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")

elif hasattr(torch.backends, 'mps') and torch.backends.mps.is_available() and torch.backends.mps.is_built():
   device = torch.device("mps")
   print("Using Apple Silicon MPS")

else:
   print("Using CPU")
```

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Hardware Setup

> **‚ö° Important:** Follow these steps in exact sequence for proper device connection

1. **Power On Device**
   - Turn on your NxBCI device and wait for initialization to complete

2. **Switch to TCP Mode**
   - Set your NxBCI device to **TCP mode**

3. **Network Connection**
   - Connect your computer to the Wi-Fi network: **`ESP32-EEG`**
   - Wait for stable connection establishment

4. **Test Connection (Optional)**
   ```bash
   python Examples/TCP_Receiver_demo.py
   ```
   You should see real-time EMG multi-channel plots

5. **Verify Connection Status**
   - üîÑ **Blinking LED**: Device ready for connection
   - üîµ **Solid Blue LED**: Connection established successfully
   
   > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The device supports only **one TCP client** at a time. Close `TCP_Receiver_demo.py` before proceeding.

### Step 2: Launch Application

Start the main application from the project root directory:

```bash
python App.py
```

You should see the main interface with three primary functions:
- üìä **Data Collection**
- üéØ **Model Training** 
- üëÅÔ∏è **Live Predictions**

![Application Interface](./images/GUI.png)

### Step 3: Using the Application

#### Data Collection

The data collection process captures EMG signals for different hand gestures through six sequential phases:

1. **Calibration Phase**
   - Keep your arms completely relaxed and still
   - This establishes a baseline to filter out movement artifacts

2. **Fist Gesture**
   - Clench your fist and maintain the position
   - Follow on-screen timing instructions

3. **Wrist Left**
   - Move your wrist to the left and hold the position
   - Maintain consistent muscle tension during collection

4. **Wrist Right**
   - Move your wrist to the right and hold the position
   - Keep the movement steady and controlled

5. **Fingers Apart**
   - Spread all five fingers wide apart
   - Focus on strengthening tension in middle and ring fingers
   - This helps distinguish from the victory gesture

6. **Victory Gesture**
   - Make a "V" or scissors gesture with index and middle fingers
   - Perform the gesture quickly and repeatedly during collection
   - Avoid clenching when retracting fingers to prevent confusion with fist gesture

> **üìÅ Data Storage:** Each gesture's EMG data is saved as a separate file. Back up existing data before collecting new samples to prevent overwriting.

#### Model Training

Click "Train Model" to start the neural network training process:

![Train Model Interface](./images/train.png)

- Expected completion time: **< 1 minute** with GPU/MPS acceleration
- Training typically converges within **50 epochs**
- Progress bar shows real-time training status

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Note:** If training is slow, verify that PyTorch is using GPU acceleration.

Upon completion, the application automatically activates real-time prediction mode for immediate testing.
